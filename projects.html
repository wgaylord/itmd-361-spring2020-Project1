	<h1> Opensource Projects</h1>
	<p>Opensource projects I developed or take part in</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <a href=https://satnogs.org>SatNOGS</a>
		<em>Satellite Network of Ground Stations</em>
		<p>This project uses raspberry pis and RTLSDRs to create a global network of ground stations for lsitening to satelites in oribt.</p>
		<p>I run a ground station for this project and also contribute to this project in to ways</p>

          <li>
	    <a href=https://https://satnogs.jwgtechs.com/>Realtime Satnogs Network Activity Map</a>
		<p>This project uses the api from the Network site of the SatNOGS project to create a map showing what sattellites are being actively listened to and what stations are listening to them.</p>
	        <p>The code for the majority of this was writen in December of 2018 with major changes happening around Feburary of 2019.</p>
	        <p>The current source code is available from a <a href=https://gitlab.com/chibill/satnogsmap>Gitlab Repository</a></p>
	        <p>I am currently working on a new version of the website using Django instead of Flask as the backend. It has its own <a href=https://gitlab.com/chibill/satnogsglobalnetworkmonitor>Gitlab Repositoy.</a></p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
		<strong>Satnogs Network Activity Replay Map</strong>
		<p>This project uses the api from the Network site of the SatNOGS project to create a map showing a replay of an event for a single satellite on the network.</p>
	        <p>This started as a neat way to reply Internation Space Station Slow Scan TV events. (ISS SSTV) But has evolved to allow replaying any satellite on the network.</p>
		<p>This project is not currently being developed or mantainted due to how sloppy the code currently is. Its current code is available from a <a href=https://gitlab.com/chibill/satnogsmapreplay>Gitlab Repositorty</a></p>
		<p>I will eventually be merging this into the new Realtime Satnogs Network Activity Map. This is expected to happen far in the future.</p>
