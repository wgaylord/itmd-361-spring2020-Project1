    <p>Things I do for fun and just because I enjoy them.</p>

	<em>Amateur Radio</em>
	<p>Also known as Ham Radio.</p>
	<p>Amateur Radio is a part of the FCC's rules that allow individuals access to spcific ranges of frequences, also know as bands, to speak and/or exchange information on.</p>
	<p>I currently have what is know as a General Class license. This gives be access to the HF bands which extend from 135.7 Khz to 29.7 Mhz.</p>
	<p>I also have access to frequencise above 50Mhz all the way up any frequency above 275 Ghz.</p>
